    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p class="header-description">
      The Iterative Method or Approximation Method in Game Theory is used to
      find approximate solutions to complex games, especially when exact
      solutions are computationally intensive or infeasible to determine
      analytically. This method involves iteratively improving strategies based
      on feedback and evaluating outcomes. Players start with initial strategies
      and iteratively adjust them based on the observed outcomes and responses
      of other players.
